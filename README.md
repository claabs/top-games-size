### Details

Platform exclusives are listed so games on the less desirable platforms are only on a need-to-have basis. (e.g. Xbox with bad compression)

The ROM/ISO dump associated with each file is an approximated match by title. Some games will be wrong due to regional/platform title differences.

The size is the uncompressed size. Multi-disc games show the final disc, and are all summed to be the size for the game.

A running total column is listed to assist with estimating storage size for the top-n games.

The platform must be in both [RetroArch's RDBs](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/tree/master/rdb), and in [Metacritic's database](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/) to be listed.
